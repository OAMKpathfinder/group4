## How to Install Locally

1. Do `npm install` in every folder [admin, backend, frontend]
2. Install `npx` globally - `npm install -g npx`
3. Create a `.env` file in the backend folder with the contents in `.env.example` updated with your credentials.
4. Run `npm start` in every folder.

NOTE: The database should be automatically created if the backend was successfully connected to a Postgres instance.
